# Linux Commands and Their Uses
Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of each of those common Linux commands:

1. **ls**  
**Meaning:** Lists the contents of a directory.  
"ls" shows files and folders in the current directory.  
Use "ls -l" for a detailed list or `ls -a` to show hidden files.


2. **cd**  
**Meaning:** Changes the current directory.  
"cd Documents" moves into the "Documents" directory.  
"cd .." goes back one directory level; `cd ~` goes to your home directory.

3. **mkdir**  
**Meaning:** Creates a new directory (folder).  
"mkdir projects" creates a new folder called "projects".

4. **touch**  
**Meaning:** Creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.  
"touch notes.txt" creates an empty text file named "notes.txt".

5. **rm**  
Removes (deletes) files or directories.  
"rm oldfile.txt" deletes the file "oldfile.txt".  
"rm -r foldername" deletes a folder and all its contents permanently.
